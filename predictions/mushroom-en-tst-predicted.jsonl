According to historical records, in 1931, out of a total population of approximately 4,500 people, around 2,800 were Jewish.\n\nThe Jewish community in O\u017car\u00f3w had a rich cultural and religious life. They had their own synagogue, schools, and various organizations. The town also had a large market where Jews sold textiles, leather goods, and other merchandise.\n\nHowever, during the Holocaust, most of the Jewish population was killed or forced to flee. In 1942, the Nazis established a labor camp in O\u017car\u00f3w, which was later transformed into a concentration camp. Thousands of Jews from various parts of Poland were brought there and subjected to forced labor, starvation, and brutal treatment. Many died from disease or were killed during mass shootings. By the end of the war, only a few hundred Jews survived out of the pre-war population of around 2,800.\n\nToday, there are several sites in O\u017car\u00f3w that commemorate its Jewish history. These include the ruins of the synagogue, which have been turned into a memorial site, and the Jewish cemetery, which has been restored and is now a protected monument.

There, in 1975, his unit was involved in an incident in which a group of soldiers killed a South Korean civilian. This led to his demotion and transfer to a less prestigious unit. Following the assassination of Kim Jong-il in 2011, and the subsequent power struggle between his two sons, Kim Jung-un and Kim Young Un, it was widely speculated that Chohung would be appointed Prime minister. However, this did not happen and Chung Eui-Yong was instead chosen. It is not clear if Chon was ever considered for the position.
